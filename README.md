NOTES/ Things to resolve/ figure out:
 1. algorithms suited for sequential data apart from the ones mentioned below?
 2. Can we treat this as a problem to predict next word or character in a sequence?
 3. Models to experiment with:
    a. Decision Trees
    b. HMM
    c. RNN
    d. Random Forest
    e. Ensemble methods
 4. Try to put weights on moves based on who won?
